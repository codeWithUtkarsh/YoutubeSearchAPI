# YoutubeSearchAPI
I have used search apis of the Youtube and created a spring boot application over that to get all the search results in the form of list.

## Getting Started

Clone this project and add an API_KEY in application.properties and then run the main java file as the application.

The Java should be installed into your local syatem. I use eclipse, you can use any other IDE of your choice to run spring boot application. I will install the dependencies from MAVEN repository. So, make sure MAVEN is installed.
